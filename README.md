# Introduction to Data Structure and Algorithms in C Programming

It is the very basic of data structures and algorithms all done in C Programming Language.

A more advanced Algorithms & Data Structure repo will be seen either in my learn Java or in a new repo but for now this shall be it.

## What does it have?

Most consists of Searching and Sorting Algorithms with Arrays and Objects and like the cheat sheet code for mem allocation. Also has like the basic of how to create an Array and LinkedList and others not specifically mentioned in this readme.md
<br />

### Arrays in C

How do Arrays work?

It is written like -> *Data_Type* *variable_name[]* *assignment*

Example: char ch[] = "June";

inputting values inside the brackets is a way to set how big a array is.

Example ch[4] will make the array 4 spaces big.\n
If in the array example above, ch[3], it would return an error as June is 4 spaces big and the array on holds up to 3 spaces.\n
Leaving it empty as show in the original example will make it as big as the input or the assigned value.
